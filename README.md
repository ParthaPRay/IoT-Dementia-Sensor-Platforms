In todayâ€™s world, 46.8 million people suffer from brain related diseases. Dementia is most prevalent of all. In general scenario, a dementia patient lacks proper guidance in searching out the way to return back at his/her home. Thus, increasing the risk of getting damaged at individual-health level. Therefore, it is important to track their movement in more sophisticated manner as possible. With emergence of wearables, GPS sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), such devices have become available in public domain. Smartphone apps support caregiver to locate the dementia patients in real-time. RF, GSM, 3G, Wi-Fi and 4G technology fill the communication gap between patient and caregiver to bring them closer. In this paper, we incorporated 7 most popular wearables for investigation to seek appropriateness for dementia tracking in recent times in systematic manners. We performed an in-depth review of these wearables as per the cost, technology wise and application wise characteristics. A case novel study i.e. IoT-based Force Sensor Resistance enabled System-FSRIoT, has been proposed and implemented to validate the effectiveness of IoT in the domain of smarter dementia patient tracking in wearable form factor. The results show promising aspect of a whole new notion to leverage efficient assistive physio-medical healthcare to the dementia patients and the affected family members to reduce life risks and achieve a better social life.
